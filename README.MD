In the directory "example", an example of a vibration analysis given. The "problem_description.jpg" illustrates the problem considered, and the "mesh_slenderRing.txt" is the mesh used. The incompatible mode element [1] is used for discretization, and the generalized eigenvalue problem is solved using Spectra library.



To run the executable "main" in the directory "build", open the terminal in the directory and enter
  ./main ../mesh_slenderRing.txt
